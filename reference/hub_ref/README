HUB SCORE REFERENCE DATA FOR UNIT TEST
--------------------------------------

Data provided by Alex Dickson, deposted by TJL (9.14.12). Here is his msg
regarding the format of the data.

"Here's a test case.  It is a 11-node network with cuu = 0.5.

node_1.csv and edge_1.csv are data files to plot the network,
hub_msm_1.dat has the hub scores (format:  "node weight hubscore"),
hub_msm_data_1.dat has the h_c values  (format:  "node from to fraction"),
ratemat_1.dat is the rate matrix (column index = "to", row index = "from").

(for the purposes of the paper, index 0 is the "folded" state)

Let me know if you have any problems, or if everything turns out well :)

-Alex"

TJL renamed the following files:

hub_msm_1.dat      --> hub_scores.dat
hub_msm_data_1.dat --> fraction_visited.dat

which is a little clearer in his mind.
