    ----------

    distances_path : str
        Path to a file that contains/will contain the assignments, as a 2D array
        of integers in hdf5 format
    chunk_size : int
        The number of frames to load and process per step. The optimal number
        here depends on your system memory -- it should probably be roughly
        the number of frames you can fit in memory at any one time. Note, this
        is only important if your trajectories are long, as the effective chunk_size
        is really `min(traj_length, chunk_size)`
    atom_indices_to_load : {None, list}
        The indices of the atoms to load for each trajectory chunk. Note that
        this method is responsible for loading up atoms from the project, but
        does NOT load up the generators. Those are passed in as a trajectory
        object (above). So if the generators are already subsampled to a restricted
        set of atom indices, but the trajectories on disk are NOT, you'll
        need to pass in a set of indices here to resolve the difference.
    traj_indices : np.ndarray, optional
        an array with a row for each trajectory in your project. 
        Each item contains two indices corresponding
