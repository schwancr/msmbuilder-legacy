"""
This should be documented better somewhere, because it will cause cryptic
errors if you don't do it. Whatever data structure you return from
prepare_trajectory() needs to support slice sytax. If you return an array or
something, then this is no problem, but if you create your own object to hold
the data that prepare_trajectory() returns, you need to add a __getitem__(),
__setitem__() and __len__() methods. See the RMSD.TheoData object for an
example. Also, if you're not familiar with this side of python these docs
(http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#emulating-container-types)
are pretty good. Only __getitem__, __setitem__ and __len__ are necessary.
