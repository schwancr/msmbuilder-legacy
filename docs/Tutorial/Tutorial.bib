  abstract = {A recognized shortcoming in current protein simulations is that most
	force fields are parametrized with relatively primitive three-site
	water models. Since the deficiencies of the common three-site water
	models in reproducing the phase diagram of water are well-known,
	an improved description of the solvent will be required, for example,
	to study proteins in molecular simulations at thermodynamic conditions
	other than standard temperature and pressure. Here, we combine a
	protein force field derived from Amber ff03 together with the highly
	optimized TIP4P/2005 water model, with a small backbone modification
	to match the population of helical states obtained with the new water
	model to experiment. Remarkably, we find that the resulting force
	field, Amber ff03w, produces a more cooperative helix-coil transition,
	compared with the similarly "backbone-corrected" Amber ff03* model
	with TIP3P water, with calculated helix propagation parameters in
	good agreement with the experiment. The radius of gyration for nonhelical
	conformations is significantly larger for Amber ff03w than for Amber
	ff03* and shows a collapse with increasing temperature as found in
	single-molecule experiments on longer proteins. The origin of the
	collapse appears to be a more favorable enthalpic component of the
	peptide-solvent interaction and is correlated with increasing turn
	formation, in accord with the experiment. In addition to this enhanced
	cooperativity, we verify that, with the new force field, replica
	exchange folding simulations of the GB1 hairpin and Trp cage result
	in folded structures, starting from completely unfolded initial conditions;
	simulations of folded proteins are also stable. These results together
	suggest that Amber ff03w (with TIP4P/2005) will be well suited for
	studying protein folding and properties of unfolded state and intrinsically
	disordered proteins over a wide range of thermodynamic conditions.},

	human diseases, such as protein misfolding diseases like Alzheimer’s
	disease. Solving the folding problem will ultimately require a combination
	of theory, simulation, and experiment, with theory and simulation
	providing an atomically detailed picture of both the thermodynamics
	and kinetics of folding and experimental tests grounding these models
	in reality. However, theory and simulation generally fall orders
	of magnitude short of biologically relevant time scales. Here we
	report significant progress toward closing this gap: an atomistic
	model of the folding of an 80-residue fragment of the λ repressor
	protein with explicit solvent that captures dynamics on a 10 milliseconds
	time scale. In addition, we provide a number of predictions that
	warrant further experimental investigation. For example, our model’s
	native state is a kinetic hub, and biexponential kinetics arises
	from the presence of many free-energy basins separated by barriers
	of different heights rather than a single low barrier along one reaction
	coordinate (the previously proposed incipient downhill folding scenario).},

  abstract = {The understanding of protein–ligand binding is of critical importance
	for biomedical research, yet the process itself has been very difficult
	to study because of its intrinsically dynamic character. Here, we
	have been able to quantitatively reconstruct the complete binding
	process of the enzyme-inhibitor complex trypsin-benzamidine by performing
	495 molecular dynamics simulations of free ligand binding of 100 ns
	each, 187 of which produced binding events with an rmsd less than
	2 Å compared to the crystal structure. The binding paths obtained
	are able to capture the kinetic pathway of the inhibitor diffusing
	from solvent (S0) to the bound (S4) state passing through two metastable
	intermediate states S2 and S3. Rather than directly entering the
	binding pocket the inhibitor appears to roll on the surface of the
	protein in its transition between S3 and the final binding pocket,
	whereas the transition between S2 and the bound pose requires rediffusion
	to S3. An estimation of the standard free energy of binding gives
	ΔG° = -5.2 ± 0.4 kcal/mol (cf. the experimental value -6.2 kcal/mol),
	and a two-states kinetic model kon = (1.5 ± 0.2) × 108 M-1 s-1 and
	koff = (9.5 ± 3.3) × 104 s-1 for unbound to bound transitions. The
	ability to reconstruct by simple diffusion the binding pathway of
	an enzyme-inhibitor binding process demonstrates the predictive power
	of unconventional high-throughput molecular simulations. Moreover,
	the methodology is directly applicable to other molecular systems
	and thus of general interest in biomedical and pharmaceutical research.},

  abstract = {There is a gap between kinetic experiment and simulation in their
	views of the dynamics of complex biomolecular systems. Whereas experiments
	typically reveal only a few readily discernible exponential relaxations,
	simulations often indicate complex multistate behavior. Here, a theoretical
	framework is presented that reconciles these two approaches. The
	central concept is "dynamical fingerprints" which contain peaks at
	the time scales of the dynamical processes involved with amplitudes
	determined by the experimental observable. Fingerprints can be generated
	from both experimental and simulation data, and their comparison
	by matching peaks permits assignment of structural changes present
	in the simulation to experimentally observed relaxation processes.
	The approach is applied here to a test case interpreting single molecule
	fluorescence correlation spectroscopy experiments on a set of fluorescent
	peptides with molecular dynamics simulations. The peptides exhibit
	complex kinetics shown to be consistent with the apparent simplicity
	of the experimental data. Moreover, the fingerprint approach can
	be used to design new experiments with site-specific labels that
	optimally probe specific dynamical processes in the molecule under
	investigation.},

	whose transition matrix corresponds to an ergodic Markov chain. For
	multiple short MD simulations of a globular protein (as in distributed
	computing), the steady state, i.e., stationary distribution determined
	using the largest ergodic component, yields more accurate free energy
	profiles and mean first passage times than the original network or
	the ergodic network obtained by imposing detailed balance by means
	of symmetrization of the transition counts.},
