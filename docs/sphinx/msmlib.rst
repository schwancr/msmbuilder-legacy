MSM Construction: :mod:`msmbuilder.MSMLib`
============================================

Functions for building MSMs

Notes
-----
* Assignments typically refer to a numpy array of integers such that Assignments[i,j] gives the state of trajectory i, frame j.
* Transition and Count matrices are typically stored in scipy.sparse.csr_matrix format.
* Some functionality from this module was moved into msmanalysis in version2.6
