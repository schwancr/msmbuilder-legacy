Lumping: :mod:`msmbuilder.lumping`
============================================

Lumping, or coarse-graining, refers to the processing of creating a few-state model from a many-state model (lumping states together) in such a way that the lumped model can capture the long timescale dynamics (i.e. joining together states which interconvert rapidly)
