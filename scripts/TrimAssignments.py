Trims assignments based on the distance to their generator. Useful for
eliminating bad assignments from a coase clustering. Note that this
discards (expensive!) data, so should only be used if an optimal
clustering is not available.

Note: Check your cluster sized with CalculateClusterRadii.py to get
a handle on how big they are before you trim. Recall the radius is the
*average* distance to the generator, here you are enforcing the
*maximum* distance.

Output: A trimmed assignments file (Assignments.Trimmed.h5).""")
